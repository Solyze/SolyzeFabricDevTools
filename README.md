# SolyzeFabricDevTools (1.19.4)

I'm working on some stuff on 1.19.4, and I wanted to create my own little Fabric mod to make my life easier when developing.
Planning to add support for 1.21.1 if it doesn't already work (I might never do this as I'm lazy and forgetful, but I will try to remember it)

This is my first proper Fabric mod btw.
